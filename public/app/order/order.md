@page order <app-order>

## <app-order>

The `app-order` component contains the order form necessary to place an order at a restaurant. The restaurant model can either be placed in as the `restaurant` property or identified via a `slug` (the restaurants short name) and then loaded.

@demo app/order/demo.html

Use it like this:

    <app-order slug="spago"></app-order>
